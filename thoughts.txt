In about 6 hours was able to...

create new project with the vue cli tools

install and explore the vue devtools extension in chrome

configure the vue spa router

create vue components managing state in different ways

implement vuex flux-pattern library

verify debugging with breakpoints, inspector, and sourcemap works correctly.

the cli tools seem production-ready, they include presets for variety of
bundling options, development server, unit testing and e2e testing.

documentation is awesome

couldn't be happier with vue js framework
